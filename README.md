## Proxy Questions

- ### The OpenZeppelin upgrade tool for hardhat defends against 6 kinds of mistakes. What are they and why do they matter?

1. It doesn't allow a deployment with external libraries linked to the implementation contract. (External libraries are not yet supported.)

2. It doesn't allow use of immutable variables, which are not unsafe
3. It doesn't allow defining a constructor.
4. It doesn't allow the use of `delegatecall`, `selfdestruct` operations in implementation. Incorrect use of this option can put funds at risk of permanent loss.
5. It doesn't allow UUPS implementations that do not contain a public upgradeTo function.
6. It doesn't allow variable renaming and replacement and checks for contract storage just to expand in order to prevent storage collision.

- ### What is a beacon proxy used for?

The main use case of beacon is when different proxies point to same implementation and if it were beacon with changing implmentation all proxies updates with same implemntation.
Beacon proxy has 3 reserved slot. The beacon address is stored in storage slot uint256(keccak256('eip1967.proxy.beacon')) - 1, so that it doesnâ€™t conflict with the storage layout of the implementation behind the proxy. One slot for admin addres and one for implementation based on eip1967 that can be used if it is not a beacon.

- ### Why does the openzeppelin upgradeable tool insert something like uint256[50] private \_\_gap; inside the contracts? To see it, create an upgradeable smart contract that has a parent contract and look in the parent.

The `uint256[50] private __gap;` declaration inserted by the OpenZeppelin upgradeable tool serves as a "storage gap." This technique reserves storage slots in a base contract, allowing future versions of the contract to use these slots without disrupting child contract storage layouts. This approach enhances contract upgradability by preventing unintended impacts on derived contracts' storage, ensuring smoother and safer upgrades over time.

- ### What is the difference between initializing the proxy and initializing the implementation? Do you need to do both? When do they need to be done?

Initializing the proxy involves executing any necessary setup or configuration for the proxy itself. Like setting initial state variables. This initialization typically happens during the initial deployment of the proxy contract.
Initializing the implementation involves executing any necessary setup for the logic of the contract. Like setting default parameters, like name, symbol and totalSupply of an ERC20 contract or any other actions specific to the contract's logic. This initialization process usually occurs when you upgrade the contract's implementation to a new version

- ### What is the use for the reinitializer? Provide a minimal example of proper use in Solidity

The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.

A reinitializer may be used after the original initialization step. This is essential to configure modules that are added through upgrades and that require initialization.

When version is 1, this modifier is similar to initializer, except that functions marked with reinitializer cannot be nested. If one is invoked in the context of another, execution will revert.

Note that versions can jump in increments greater than 1; this implies that if multiple reinitializers coexist in a contract, executing them in the right order is up to the developer or operator.

    contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
        function initialize() initializer public {
            __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
        }
    }

    contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
        function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
            __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
        }
    }
